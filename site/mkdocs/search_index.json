Then you can seamlessly connect Zeppelin and ZeppelinHub.\n\n\nShare your notebook with anyone, anywhere.\n\n\nApache Zeppelin provides a beautiful visualization for your data analysis results. Using ZeppelinHub, you can privately and publically publish the results to anyone you want to share. As you make changes in Zeppelin, it will be reflected to ZeppelinHub immediately.\n\n\nCreate teams and spaces for sharing private notebooks.\n\n\nZeppelinHub space is a unit of notebook sharing. You can privately share notebooks only your team having an access permission. In ZeppelinHub, you can leave some comments in your notebook for the dynamic team work.\n\n\nDiscover the best of Zeppelin Notebooks\n\n\nZeppelinHub Viewer\n is a community site for sharing Zeppelin notebooks. Using Viewer, you can explore some dramatic examples of Zeppelin notebooks. You can find more specific information about ZeppelinHub Viewer at \nWhat is ZeppelinHub Viewer\n section.\n\n\nZeppelin Multitenancy\n\n\nIn organization, it is not feaseble to make all users install and configure Zeppelin. With single URL, all users go to get their own, containerized version of Zeppelin, utilising resources of the shared cluster.\n\nZeppelin Multitenancy\n makes using Zeppelin with ZeppelinHub easier in multi-user environment.

Once you register and integrate Zeppelin with ZeppelinHub, you can privately share your notebooks and communicate via the notebooks with your team members. The following illustration shows a basic concept of ZeppelinHub.\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts\n\n\nFor trully using ZeppelinHub service, there are some components and processes needed to understand. \n\n\nYour ZeppelinHub Account\n\n\nIt is pretty straightforward to join ZeppelinHub. When you create an account, you will be asked for your \nRegistration Code\n. Since it is not a unique code for only one person, you can share this code within your organization. For the more detail information, please read \nManaging your ZeppelinHub Account\n section.\n\n\nZeppelin Instance\n\n\nYou might wonder how you can install and configure Zeppelin. If so, please read \nZeppelin Installation\n first. As you can see in the above illustration, you can manage several \nZeppelin instances\n in your ZeppelinHub account. ( \nInstance\n is not a strange word. It is just a unit of Zeppelin. ) Once you add a new instance to ZeppelinHub, it will generate a \nUnique Token\n only for that Zeppelin instance. This token is used to identify your Zeppelin instance with ZeppelinHub. More specific explanation about Zeppelin integration is in \nZeppelin integration with ZeppelinHub\n.\n\n\nSpace\n\n\nZeppelinHub \nSpace\n is a unit of sharing notebooks. Using space, you can gather your own and shared notebooks from your team members efficiently. When you create a space, you can invite your team members having a same \nRegistration Code\n. Only invited people can have an access permission to the shared notebooks.\nFor the further details, please refer to \nSharing your Notebooks\n.",
