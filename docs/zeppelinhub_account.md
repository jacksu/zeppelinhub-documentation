# Managing your ZeppelinHub Account

In this section, we will help you to get your foot in the door. 

## Create your ZeppelinHub Account
Since ZeppelinHub is **private** Zeppelin notebook sharing tool, you need your own account.

As you can see in the above screenshot image, there is nothing special to write down your basic information except **Registration Code**. This unique code is provided to identify your company members. The code can be shared within your organization so that you can invite them to your space. As a result, you can share and communicate only with your people. 

All the process for the registration is done. Welcome to ZeppelinHub!
