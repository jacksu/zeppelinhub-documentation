# Overview

Welcome to ZeppelinHub! 

ZeppelinHub enables you to share your Zeppelin notebooks. Once you register and integrate Zeppelin with ZeppelinHub, you can privately share your notebooks and communicate via the notebooks with your team members. The following illustration shows a basic concept of ZeppelinHub.

For trully using ZeppelinHub service, there are some componets and processes needed to understand. 

* **Your ZeppelinHub Account** <br/>
It is pretty straightforward to join ZeppelinHub. When you create an account, you will be asked for your **Registration Code**. Since it is not a unique code for only one person, you can share this code within your organization and invite people. More detailed informations is in [Register your Invitation Code](./register_invitation_code.html) section.

* **Zeppelin Instance** <br/>
You might wonder how you can install and configure Zeppelin. If so, please read [Zeppelin Installation](http://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/install/install.html) first. As you can see in the above illustrartion, you can manage several **Zeppelin instances** in your ZeppelinHub account. ( An **Instance** is not a strange word. It is just a unit of Zeppelin. ) Once you add a new instance in Hub, it will generate a unique **token** only for that Zeppelin instance. This token is used to integrate your Zeppelin instance with ZeppelinHub. More specific explanation is in [Zeppelin integration with ZeppelinHub](./zeppelin_integration.html).

* **Space** <br/>
ZeppelinHub space is a unit of sharing notebooks. Likewise adding Zeppelin instances, you can also create and have several spaces at once. Space allows you to gather your notebooks and notebooks shared with you. It's a convenient way to organize notebooks. Please visit [How you can share notebooks?](./sharing_notebooks.html) section.

* **Who can access** <br/>
When you create a space, you can add members so that they can have an access permission. Also, you can freely add more people in the future. For the specific informtaion about the permission, please read [Inviting users to your Space](./invite_users.html) section.
