# Getting Started
Welcome!! Follow these steps to setup your ZeppelinHub account.

<br/>
## Create an Instance

In order to connect your instance of Apache Zeppelin, and have your notebooks listed on ZeppelinHub, you will have to [add your Zeppelin instance](zeppelin_instances.html "Add an Instance").

<br/>
## Integrate with Apache Zeppelin

After getting your token from previous step, you can now start [configuring Apache Zeppelin](zeppelin_integration.html "Connect Zeppelin") to syncronize its notebooks with ZeppelinHub.

<br/>
## Start sharing your notebooks

Congratulations! Your ZeppelinHub is now configured and you should already see the notebooks appearing.

Now it's time to start [sharing your notebooks](sharing_notebooks.html "Share Notebooks") with other people.
