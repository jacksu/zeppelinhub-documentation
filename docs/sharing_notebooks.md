# Sharing your Notebooks

You can privately and publically publish the Zeppelin notebook results to anyone you want to share using ZeppelinHub. As soon as you make any changes in Zeppelin, it will be reflected to ZeppelinHub immediately. In this documentation, we will explain how to create a space and how you can share Zeppelin notebooks and communicate with your team members.


## What is Space?
ZeppelinHub Space is a unit of sharing notebooks. Using space, you can gather your own and shared notebooks from your team members efficiently. When you create a space, you can invite your team members. As a result, only invited people have an access permission to shared notebooks. A Space allows you to gather both **Notebooks** and **Users**. Make it a perfect place to share your new notebooks with your coworkers !

## Creating a Space
Let's create a space.

After click **Plus Button**<img src="../img/plus_button.png"/>, type your space name and a short description. 

<img src="../img/type_space_name.png" width="55%" height="55%" style="box-shadow: 7px 7px 15px #999999;"/>

Then you can see your spaces list in the dashboard.

You can identify the notebook information in the Space such as **the origin Zeppelin instance name of this notebook**, **the notebook creator name** and **the date of Last update**. 

## Adding Notebooks to the Space
There are two ways for publishing a Notebook to a Space.

1. Just **Drag and Drop** your notebook to the space.

## Inviting your team members to the Space
In the space, you can grant an access permission to your members. Once someone is added to your space, he (or maybe she) can see your space in his ZeppelinHub dashboard.

You can also give some feedbacks about the shared notebooks. Click **Conversation Button** <img src="../img/conversation_button.png"/>at the top of the notebook and start a conversation with your people about the report.
